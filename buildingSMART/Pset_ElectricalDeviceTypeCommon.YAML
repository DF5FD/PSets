Protective Earth is sometimes also known as CPC or common protective conductor. Note that for an electrical device, a set of line conductor functions may be applied.'

  definition: 'Insulation standard classes provides basic protection information against electric shock. Defines levels of insulation required in terms of constructional requirements (creepage and clearance distances) and electrical requirements (compliance with electric strength tests). Basic insulation is considered to be shorted under single fault conditions. The actual values required depend on the working voltage to which the insulation is subjected, as well as other factors. Also indicates whether the electrical device has a protective earth connection.'
