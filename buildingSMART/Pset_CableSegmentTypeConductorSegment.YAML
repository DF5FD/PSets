definition: 'An electrical conductor is a single linear element with the specific purpose to lead electric current. The core of one lead is normally single wired or multiwired which are intertwined. According to IEC 60050: IEV 195-01-07, a conductor is a conductive part intended to carry a specified electric current.'
