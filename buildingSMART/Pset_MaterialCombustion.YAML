  definition: 'Specific heat of the products of combustion: heat energy absorbed per temperature unit.'
  localizations: []
- name: N20Content
  definition: Nitrous oxide (N2O) content of the products of combustion. This is measured in weight of N2O per unit weight and is therefore unitless.
  localizations: []
- name: COContent
  definition: Carbon monoxide (CO) content of the products of combustion. This is measured in weight of CO per unit weight and is therefore unitless.
  localizations: []
- name: CO2Content
  definition: Carbon dioxide (CO2) content of the products of combustion. This is measured in weight of CO2 per unit weight and is therefore unitless.
