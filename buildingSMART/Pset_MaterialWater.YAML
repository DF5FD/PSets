definition: A set of extended material properties for of water typically used within the context of building services and flow distribution systems.
applicableIfcClasses:
- name: IfcMaterial
  type: IfcMaterial
properties:
- name: IsPotable
  definition: If TRUE, then the water is considered potable.
  localizations: []
- name: Hardness
  definition: Water hardness as positive, multivalent ion concentration in the water (usually concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions in terms of calcium carbonate).
  localizations: []
- name: AlkalinityConcentration
  definition: Maximum alkalinity concentration (maximum sum of concentrations of each of the negative ions substances measured as CaCO3).
  localizations: []
- name: AcidityConcentration
  definition: Maximum CaCO3 equivalent that would neutralize the acid.
  localizations: []
- name: ImpuritiesContent
  definition: Fraction of impurities such as dust to the total amount of water. This is measured in weight of impurities per weight of water and is therefore unitless.
  localizations: []
- name: DissolvedSolidsContent
  definition: Fraction of the dissolved solids to the total amount of water. This is measured in weight of dissolved solids per weight of water and is therefore unitless.
  localizations: []
- name: PHLevel
  definition: Maximum water PH in a range from 0-14.
