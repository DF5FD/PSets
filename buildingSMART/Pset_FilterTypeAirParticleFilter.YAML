  definition: 'A panel dry type extended surface filter is a dry-type air filter with random fiber mats or blankets in the forms of pockets, V-shaped or radial pleats, and include the following:CoarseFilter: Filter with a efficiency lower than 30% for atmosphere dust-spot.CoarseMetalScreen: Filter made of metal screen.CoarseCellFoams: Filter made of cell foams.CoarseSpunGlass: Filter made of spun glass.MediumFilter: Filter with an efficiency between 30-98% for atmosphere dust-spot.MediumElectretFilter: Filter with fine electret synthetic fibers.MediumNaturalFiberFilter: Filter with natural fibers.HEPAFilter: High efficiency particulate air filter.ULPAFilter: Ultra low penetration air filter.MembraneFilters: Filter made of membrane for certain pore diameters in flat sheet and pleated form.A renewable media with a moving curtain viscous filter are random-fiber media coated with viscous substance in roll form or curtain where fresh media is fed across the face of the filter and the dirty media is rewound onto a roll at the bottom or to into a reservoir:RollForm: Viscous filter used in roll form.AdhesiveReservoir: Viscous filter used in moving curtain form.A renewable moving curtain dry media filter is a random-fiber dry media of relatively high porosity used in moving-curtain(roll) filters.An electrical filter uses electrostatic precipitation to remove and collect particulate contaminants.'
