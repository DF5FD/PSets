definition: A set of extended material properties of fuel energy typically used within the context of building services and flow distribution systems.
applicableIfcClasses:
- name: IfcMaterial
  type: IfcMaterial
properties:
- name: CombustionTemperature
  definition: Combustion temperature of the material when air is at 298 K and 100 kPa.
  localizations: []
- name: CarbonContent
  definition: The carbon content in the fuel. This is measured in weight of carbon per unit weight of fuel and is therefore unitless.
  localizations: []
- name: LowerHeatingValue
  definition: Lower Heating Value is defined as the amount of energy released (MJ/kg) when a fuel is burned completely, and H2O is in vapor form in the combustion products.
  localizations: []
- name: HigherHeatingValue
  definition: Higher Heating Value is defined as the amount of energy released (MJ/kg) when a fuel is burned completely, and H2O is in liquid form in the combustion products.
