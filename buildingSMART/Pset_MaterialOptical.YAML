properties:
- name: VisibleTransmittance
  definition: Transmittance at normal incidence (visible). Defines the fraction of the visible spectrum of solar radiation that passes through per unit area, perpendicular to the surface.
  localizations: []
- name: SolarTransmittance
  definition: Transmittance at normal incidence (solar). Defines the fraction of solar radiation that passes through per unit area, perpendicular to the surface.
  localizations: []
- name: ThermalIrTransmittance
  definition: Thermal IR transmittance at normal incidence. Defines the fraction of thermal energy that passes through per unit area, perpendicular to the surface.
  localizations: []
- name: ThermalIrEmissivityBack
  definition: 'Thermal IR emissivity: back side. Defines the fraction of thermal energy emitted per unit area to "blackbody" at the same temperature, through the "back" side of the material.'
  localizations: []
- name: ThermalIrEmissivityFront
  definition: 'Thermal IR emissivity: front side. Defines the fraction of thermal energy emitted per unit area to "blackbody" at the same temperature, through the "front" side of the material.'
  localizations: []
- name: VisibleReflectanceBack
  definition: 'Reflectance at normal incidence (visible): back side. Defines the fraction of the solar ray in the visible spectrum that is reflected and not transmitted when the ray passes from one medium into another, at the "back" side of the other material, perpendicular to the surface. Dependent on material and surface characteristics.'
